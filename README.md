Prodigy InfoTech Internship Task 4: Packet Sniffing Program
Task Description:
As part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I was tasked with developing a packet sniffing program. 
Packet sniffing is a technique used in cybersecurity to capture and analyze network traffic passing through a specific network interface. This tool can be useful for network monitoring, troubleshooting, and security analysis.

Program Functionality:
The Python program I developed performs the following functions:

Network Interface Selection:
The program prompts the user to input the network interface they wish to monitor.

Packet Capturing:
Once the network interface is selected, the program starts capturing and displaying all the packets received on that interface.


Security and Ethical Considerations:
While developing and running packet sniffing programs can be educational and useful for cybersecurity research, it is important to emphasize that capturing network traffic without explicit consent from the network owner and users is illegal and unethical. 
Packet sniffing should only be used in controlled environments where all parties are aware of the monitoring.

This program demonstrates a basic implementation of packet sniffing, highlighting both its potential applications in network analysis and the importance of ethical considerations when using such tools.
